          DataBridge Sites operates Maryland's largest and most secure data center facility in Silver Spring. Our 214,000 square foot facility represents Maryland's only Tier IV-designed commercial data center, delivering infrastructure reliability unmatched in the region.

          We've maintained 100% uptime for 30 years without a single electrical outage. This perfect reliability record isn't a projection or statistical claim—it's actual operational performance spanning three decades.

          Six 2.4-megawatt generators provide redundancy far exceeding those of competitors, who typically deploy only two 1-1.5 megawatt generators.

          Organizations choose DataBridge when downtime isn't an option. Whether you need secure colocation space, compliant cloud environments, or disaster recovery capabilities, our infrastructure supports your most demanding requirements without the inconvenience of traveling to Northern Virginia.
